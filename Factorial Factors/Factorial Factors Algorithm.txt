int result

find prime numbers between 2 and n //Sieve of Eratosthenes

for each prime number p
	for 1 .. logp(n)
		result += n/(p^i)

Basically, find all the prime factors of all numbers between 2 and n
by counting all of the multiples of the prime numbers.
Note: some numbers have the same factor multiple times, 
so have to go through and count all of those numbers multiple times as well

Count all the multiples of 2 (2,4,8), then 2^2 (4,8,12) then 2^3 (8,16,24) ... etc, 
then continue with 3 (3,9,12) 3^2 (9,18,27), 3^3 (27, 54, 81) ... etc,
then with 5 ... etc.
